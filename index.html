  <h1> FACTS ABOUT AIRPLANES</h1> 
   Airplanes,also known as aircraft or planes, are powered, fixed-wing machines used for flight.
They are a vital part of modern transportation, allowing people and cargo to travel vast distances in a relatively short amount of time.

<h1>HISTORY OF AIRPLANES</h1>
   The concepts of flights dates back to ancient times, but the modern airplanes was invented in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by pioneers
like Otto Lilienthal, Octave Chanute, and the Wright brothers.
   The Wright brothers successfully flew the first powered, controlled, and sustained flights on December 17, 1903. Over the years, airplanes have evolved
significantly, with advancements in materials, design, and technology leading to improved efficiency,safety, and comfort.

<h1>COMPONENTS OF AIRPLANES</h1>
An airplanes typically consists of :
<p>1. WINGS: Providing lift and stability.</p>
<p>2. FUSELAGE: The main body of the plane, housing passengers,cargo,and crew.</p>
<p>3. ENGINES: Propelling the plane forward.</p>
<p>4. TAIL: Stabilizing the plane during flight.</p>
<P>5. LANDING GEAR: Allowing the planes to take off,land ,and taxi.</P>

<h1>TYPES OF AIRPLANES</h1>
There are several types of airplanes which includes:
<P>1. COMMERCIAL AIRLINES: Transporting passengers and cargo on scheduled flights.</P>
<p>2. GENERAL AVIATION AIRCRAFTS: Privates planes for personal or business use.</p>
<p>3. EXPERIMENTAL AIRCRAFTS: Home-builts or innovative planes.</p>
<p>4. GLIDERS: Engineless planes relying on gravity and air currents.</p>

<h1>ADVANTAGES OF AIRPLANES</h1>
Airplanes offers numerous benefits,including:
<p>1. SPEED: Quickly covering long distances.</p>
<p>2. GLOBAL ACCESSIBILITIES: Connecting people and places worldwide.</p>
<p>3. COMFORT: Providing a relatively comfortable travel experience.</p>
<p>4. CARGO TRANSPORT: Moving goods and supplies efficiently.</p>
<p>5. ECONOMIC GROWTH: Supporting international trade and tourism.</p>

<h1>SAFETY FEATURES OF AN AIRPLANES</h1>
Airplanes are designed with numerous safety features, including:
<p>1. Multiple engines</p>
<p>2. Redundant systems</p>
<p>3. Weather radar and navigations system</p>
<p>4. Regular maintenance and inspections.</p>

<h1>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ON AIRPLANES</h1>
    Airplanes contribute to greenhouse gas emissions,noise pollution, and other environmental concerns.
However, effots are being made to develop more sustainable avaiation fuels, electric and hybrid-electric propulsion
systems, and more efficient aircraft design.

In conclusion, airplanes have revolutionized transportation, Connecting people and cultures worldwide. Their evolution
continues, with advancements in technology and design aiming to improve safety,efficiency, and sustainability.

<h1>WHAT CONSISTS OF AN AIRPLANES</h1>
An airplanes,also known as an aircraft, consists of several components that work together to enable flights. The main 
components of an airplanes include:

<p>1. WINGS: Provide lift, keeping the palne airborne.</p>
<p>2. COCKPITS: The control centre, where the pilots fly the planes.</p>
<p>3. AVIONICS: Electronic systems, including navigation, communication, and flight control system.</p>
<p>4. FLIGHTS CONTROL SURFACES: Ailerons,elevators,and rudder, which control the plane's oreintation and direction.</p>
<p>5. FUEL SYSTEM: Stores and distributes power to the plane's system.</p>
<p>6. ELECTRICAL SYSTEM: Generates and distributes power to the plane's system.</p>
<p>7. HYDRAULIC SYSTEM: Powers the landing gear, brakes, and other systems.</p>
<p>8. PNEUMATIC: Powers the air conditioning, pressurization, and their oxygen systems.</p>
<p>9. INTERIOR: Seats, overhead bins.</p>

<h1>LISTS OF AIRPLANES GLOBALLY</h1>
The total number of aircrafts currently in service is approximately 23,600, including passengers and cargo aircraft.
The breakdown of this number is as follows:
<p>. Active aircraft: 23,513</p>
<p>. Grounded aircraft: 5,161</p>
<p>. Narrowbody jets: 74% active</p>
<p>. Widebody and regional jets: 65% and 62% active,respectively.</p>
<p>. Turboprops: 40% active.</p>
NB: All these figures are based on data from June 2022 and May have changed since then.
